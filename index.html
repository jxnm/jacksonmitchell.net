    <p>I am a producer and editor at WBUR. I work on Project CITRUS, which explores the future of on-demand
      audio on emerging tech platforms. (I put this website together myself. It's not much, but heck, it's mine.)<br><br>

      I used to work for <em>Here & Now</em>, NPR's midday newsmagazine produced at WBUR. I started as an
      intern, and the rest is history. I managed <em>Here & Now</em>'s website, producing and editing digital articles and social
      media posts, as well as shaping the overall digital strategy of one of public radio's flagship programs.
      <br>
      In 2019, I won a fellowship to work in WBUR's iLab, leaving my regular <em>Here & Now</em> duties for one month to focus on
      a special project.
      <br>
      I graduated from the University of Connecticut in 2016 with a dual degree in journalism and American studies. When
      I'm not editing Google Docs or writing pithy Slack messages, I enjoy hiking in the White Mountains, running the
      stairs at Harvard Stadium and exploring Boston's live music scene.
